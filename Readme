#Commit 1)The method takes three parameters: n (number of elements remaining to read), arr (ArrayList containing elements read so far), and scanner (Scanner object for input).
It uses recursion to read n integers from the scanner and adds them to the ArrayList arr.
When n becomes 0 (base case), it iterates over the elements in the ArrayList to find the minimum value.
Finally, it returns the minimum value found.
